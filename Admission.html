<section id="Admission"><h2>Admission Rule</h2><p>Admission rules vary depending on the context, such as educational institutions, legal proceedings, or other formal processes. For example, in the legal domain, Rule 36 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in the U.S. outlines the process for "Requests for Admission." This allows one party in a civil case to request that another party admit or deny specific facts or the authenticity of documents, simplifying the trial process.
